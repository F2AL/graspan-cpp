# Graspan C++

Welcome to the home repository of Graspan C++.

Graspan is a disk-based parallel graph system that uses an edge-pair centric computation model to compute dynamic transitive closures on large program graphs. Graspan has been implemented in two languages: Java and C++. This repository provides the C++ implementation of Graspan.

This Readme (under revision) provides a how-to-use guide for Graspan C++. 

For a detailed description of our system, you please see the preliminary version of our paper [here](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~guoqingx/papers/wang-asplos17.pdf), which has been accepted in ASPLOS 2017. In addition, a tutorial of Graspan is scheduled to be presented in ASPLOS 2017. If you are interested, please visit our tutorial [page](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~guoqingx/asplos-tutorial/main.html).
